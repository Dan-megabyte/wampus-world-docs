We installed the necessary programming software onto Daniel’s laptop. It didn’t work initially on Daniel’s laptop and the files wouldn’t upload from his laptop to the robot. At 4:44, Daniel could finally run programs on the robot but couldn’t write to the robot’s files since the filesystem was corrupted. At 4:46, the robot could finally move on its own. Daniel and Arfan installed the Light Blue app to control the robot via bluetooth. At 4:50, Light Blue successfully connected to the robot and Daniel plugged it into his laptop. Daniel and Arfan split the programming work into Daniel handling the hardware of how the laptop communicates with the robot and Arfan doing the logic part. Bram said that the robot is not supposed to know how to solve the puzzle randomly; the robot shouldn’t know that the puzzle can be solved like the connect 4 algorithm. Daniel tested out the IR reciever/transmitter, finding a problem with the left sensor. It was replaced and now works perfectly fine.
