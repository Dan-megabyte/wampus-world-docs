We did some tests on the robot to see if it can perform basic tasks such as moving forward a certain amount and spinning in a circle. Gavin recorded the robots’ tests and made a gif of it spinning in place. The robot can stop moving forward when both sensors detect a line at the same time. It did not stop when we placed one hand over one sensor, only when both sensors were activated did the robot stop moving. The robot was also able to stop moving after crossing a line by taking the time it took to reach the line and waiting that amount of time to stop. This means that it can stop in the middle of a square if the sensors are placed in the middle of the starting square. The robot can spin 540 degrees left, not right. The robot can now spin 45 degrees to the right. The robot can now turn 70 degrees to the right. Daniel is trying to find out how much time it takes to turn 90 degrees to the right so that he can use that time for turning left. Arfan told Daniel to change to ticks (rotations of the motor) instead of seconds for measuring movement. Daniel found out that the given software was faulty and was powering the wrong motor. Gavin uploaded the robot spinning gif on tenor and it is still content pending. The robot turned different amounts on different surfaces with both wheels turning. Gavin finally saved the gif from tenor. Once it says content pending, it can be saved from tenor. The figure 8 is on a 2x3 grid. Bram said we can touch the line and calibrate as long as it doesn’t cross.
